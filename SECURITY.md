## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of "Medieval Chess" seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue.** Vulnerabilities should be disclosed responsibly.
2.  Email the repository owner directly (or use GitHub Security Advisories if enabled).
3.  Include:
    *   Description of the vulnerability
    *   Steps to reproduce
    *   Potential impact (e.g., specific game rule bypass, move spoofing spoofing)

## Anti-Cheat & Integrity

This project enforces server-side move validation and cryptographic signatures.
- **Move Fraud**: Bypassed validation logic.
- **Botting/Automation**: Undetected high-speed inputs.

Reports involving these areas are prioritized.
